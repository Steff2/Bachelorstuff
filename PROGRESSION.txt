Had struggles with the Models due to Unity's coordinate system. Solved by using the matlab converter to .obj

Initial thought was to only use predefined Needleentry points and let the surgeon choose which one to follow.
The idea was to have a window of the end position in the corner, for the surgeon to watch at. The Needle points were provided by Johanna Stratemeier's Masters projects algorithm.

Changed that to be optional and instead have no guidance for the surgeon.

Also Changed the traverse of the US device, to stick to the skin. Added trajectory in the US window.

Changed main screen layout to provide space for the US and the Helping Texts.

Struggle with Fullsurface, since Unity only supports 255 polygons with convex objects. Model with 10% of vertices still has more.

Decided to split the mesh in patches and make each individual patch convex. Using unity takes way too long to iterate all vertices (reason unkown) switching to external scripting.
